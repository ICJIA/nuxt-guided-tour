# FAQ

## How do I restart the tour?

Call `tour.resetCompletion()` to clear the localStorage flag, then show the welcome modal or call `tour.start()` directly:

```typescript
function restartTour() {
  tour.resetCompletion()
  tour.start()
}
```

## Can I skip the welcome modal?

Yes. Just call `tour.start()` directly without using `TourWelcome`:

```typescript
onMounted(() => {
  if (tour.autoStart && !tour.hasCompletedTour.value) {
    setTimeout(() => tour.start(), tour.autoStartDelay)
  }
})
```

## Can I skip the intro slides?

Yes. `TourIntro` is entirely optional. If you don't include it or pass an empty `slides` array, no intro slides will show.

## How does the highlight work on elements with overflow:hidden?

The composable automatically detects elements with `overflow: hidden` and sets a `data-tour-overflow="true"` attribute. The CSS uses `outline` (which isn't clipped by overflow) instead of `::before` pseudo-elements.

## Does it work with SSR?

Yes. All DOM operations (localStorage, document queries, keyboard listeners) are guarded with client-only checks. The components use `<Teleport to="body">` which only renders on the client.

## How do I force the tour to show again after updating?

Increment the `version` number in your `TourConfig`. The localStorage key changes from `prefix-v1` to `prefix-v2`, so all users see the tour again.

## Can I use custom components for the overlay?

The module provides ready-to-use components, but `useTour()` is a standalone composable. You can build your own overlay component that reads from `tour.isActive`, `tour.currentStep`, etc.

## What Nuxt UI version is required?

`nuxt-guided-tour` requires `@nuxt/ui >= 3.0.0` (Nuxt UI v3).

## Does it support multiple tours on one page?

You can create multiple `useTour()` instances with different configs and storage keys. Just make sure only one tour is active at a time.

## How do I style the highlight ring?

The highlight ring CSS is in `tour.css` and uses `[data-tour-active="true"]` selectors. You can override these in your app's CSS:

```css
/* Custom highlight color */
[data-tour-active="true"]::before {
  border-color: #3b82f6;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 8px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4);
}
```
